## My programs and notes for the Missing-semester

These are my notes and program which I make for fun to learn the material covered in the missing-semester curriculum, a free course hosted by MIT and presented by Anish, Jose, and Jon.

Missing semester focuses on teaching the tools often used in computer science (the shell, git, vim, tmux, etc..)
